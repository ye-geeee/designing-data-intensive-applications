We should aim to build systems that make it easy to adapt to change(_evolvability_).  
In most cases, the system requires data to change:  

- Relational databases: schema can be changed(i.e ALTER statement)
- schema-on-read: mixture of older and newer data

When a data format or schema changes, a corresponding change to application code often needs to happen.  

- server-side applications: _rolling upgrade_(_staged rollout_)
   - deploying the new version to a few nodes at a time, checking whether the new version is running smoothly, gradually working your way through all the nodes
- client-side applications: mercy of user... 

This means that old and new versions of the code, and data formats may potentially all coexist in the system at the same time.  
And we need to maintain compatibility in both directions:  

- _Backward compatibility_: Newer code can read data that was written by older code
- _Forward compatibiliry_: Older code can read data that was written by newer code

Let's have a look at a several formats for encoding data(JSON, XML, Protocol Buffers, Thrift, and Avro).  
And discuss how these formats are used for data storage and for communication: Representational State(REST), remote procedure calls (RPC), message-passing systems.
